# Information Architecture Tests

Scripts for analyzing the hierarchical information structure in CMB data, with emphasis on 
mathematical constants (φ, √2, √3, ln2, e, π) as organizing principles.

## Available Scripts

- `cmb_info_architecture.py`: Current production implementation
- Archive directory: Contains previous implementations for reference
- Runners directory: Various execution scripts for different test configurations

## Key Findings

- WMAP data showed statistical significance for Golden Ratio (φ): Score = 1.0203, p-value = 0.044838
- Square Root of 2 appears to be the dominant organizing principle across scales
- Scale 55 shows extremely strong sqrt2 specialization in both datasets
