# COSMIC Analysis

A comprehensive repository for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data analysis, focusing on information-theoretic tests and mathematical pattern detection.

## Overview

This repository contains a unified collection of analytical methods for studying the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, with particular emphasis on:

- Transfer entropy analysis
- Information architecture patterns
- Golden ratio coherence detection
- Phase alignment tests
- Cross-validation between WMAP and Planck datasets
- Fractal and scale transition analysis

## Key Findings

Preliminary findings from our analysis include:

- WMAP data showed statistical significance for Golden Ratio (Ï†): Score = 1.0203, p-value = 0.044838
- Planck data showed high significance for average layer specialization (p=0.0000)
- Square Root of 2 appears to be the dominant organizing principle across scales
- Scale 55 shows extremely strong sqrt2 specialization in both datasets (WMAP: 1.2541, Planck: 1.5465)
